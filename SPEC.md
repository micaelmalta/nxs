# RFC 001: The Nexus Standard (NXS) Specification v1.0

**Date:** April 30, 2026  
**Status:** Final Specification  
**Editors:** Gemini AI & Collaborator  
**MIME Types:** `application/nxb` (Binary), `application/nxs` (Text)

---

## 1. Abstract
NXS is a high-performance, bi-modal data serialization format that prioritizes **CPU-native memory alignment** and **O(1) random access**. By utilizing a sigil-based type system in text and a bitmask-driven, zero-copy architecture in binary, NXS eliminates the "parsing tax" common in JSON and the "rigidity tax" common in Protobuf.

## 2. Terminology
The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in **RFC 2119**.

---

## 3. The Source Format (.nxs)
The source format is a human-readable UTF-8 representation.

### 3.1 Sigils and Data Types
Every value **MUST** be prefixed with a Sigil to define its machine representation.

| Sigil | Type | Description | Binary Encoding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `=` | **Int64** | Signed 64-bit integer | `int64_t` (Little-Endian) |
| `~` | **Float64** | 64-bit floating point | `double` (IEEE 754, Little-Endian) |
| `?` | **Bool** | Truth value | `uint8_t` (0x01 or 0x00) |
| `$` | **Keyword** | Dictionary-interned key | `uint16_t` (Dict Index, Little-Endian) |
| `"` | **String** | UTF-8 Text | `uint32_t` (Len, LE) + Bytes |
| `@` | **Time** | Unix Nanoseconds | `int64_t` (Little-Endian) |
| `<>` | **Binary** | Raw Byte Stream | `uint32_t` (Len, LE) + Bytes |
| `&` | **Link** | Relative pointer | `int32_t` (Byte offset, LE) |
| `!` | **Macro** | Compile-time formula | (Resolved to base type) |
| `^` | **Null** | Explicit absent value | No payload (bitmask bit set, zero-width) |

### 3.2 String Literals and Escape Sequences
String values (sigil `"`) are enclosed in double-quote characters. The following escape sequences **MUST** be supported:

| Sequence | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `\\` | Literal backslash |
| `\"` | Literal double-quote |
| `\n` | Newline (U+000A) |
| `\r` | Carriage return (U+000D) |
| `\t` | Horizontal tab (U+0009) |
| `\0` | Null byte (U+0000) |
| `\uXXXX` | Unicode code point (4 hex digits) |
| `\UXXXXXXXX` | Unicode code point (8 hex digits) |

Any other character following `\` is a parse error. Parsers **MUST NOT** silently ignore unknown escape sequences.

### 3.3 Macro Expressions (`!`)
A Macro value is a compile-time expression resolved by the NXS compiler before binary output is produced. The expression language is a restricted arithmetic and string subset:

* **Literals:** Any base sigil value (e.g., `=10`, `~3.14`, `"hello"`).
* **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` over numeric types.
* **String concatenation:** `+` over two String operands.
* **References:** `@key` dereferences another key in the same object scope.
* **Built-ins:** `now()` (current Unix nanoseconds as Int64), `len(@key)` (byte length of a String or Binary value).

**Example:**
```text
config {
    base_url: "https://api.example.com"
    version: =2
    endpoint: !"@base_url/v" + @version
}
```

Macros **MUST** be fully resolved at compile time. A Macro that cannot be statically resolved (e.g., references a runtime value) is a compile error. The resolved value is encoded using its resulting base type.

### 3.4 Structure
* **Objects:** Defined by `{}`. Keys do not require quotes unless they contain whitespace or the characters `{}[]:"`.
* **Lists:** Defined by `[]`. Elements are comma-separated and **MUST** be of a uniform sigil type within a single list.
* **Null:** The `^` sigil stands alone with no following value token.
* **Scope:** Objects can be nested indefinitely, subject to the recursion limit defined in Section 9.

---

## 4. The Binary Format (.nxb)
The binary representation is designed for **Zero-Copy Memory Mapping**. All multi-byte integer fields use **Little-Endian** byte order unless otherwise noted.

### 4.1 Memory Alignment (The Rule of 8)
All atomic values (Int64, Float64, Temporal) **MUST** start at a file offset that satisfies the following condition:

$$Offset \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$$

The compiler **MUST** insert null bytes (`0x00`) as padding to maintain this alignment. Strings and Binary blobs are length-prefixed and **MUST** also be padded at their tail to ensure the *next* value is aligned.

Bool values are 1 byte; the compiler **MUST** insert 7 bytes of padding after each Bool.

### 4.2 File Layout
A `.nxb` file consists of four segments in order:

```
[Preamble 32B][Schema Header][Data Sector][Tail-Index]
```

#### 4.2.1 Preamble (exactly 32 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 4 | `Magic` | `0x4E585342` (`NXSB`) |
| 4 | 2 | `Version` | `0x0100` (major=1, minor=0) |
| 6 | 2 | `Flags` | Bit 0: Jumbo Offsets; Bit 1: Schema Embedded; Bits 2–15: reserved (MUST be 0) |
| 8 | 8 | `DictHash` | 64-bit MurmurHash3 of the Schema Header bytes |
| 16 | 8 | `TailPtr` | Absolute byte offset to the start of the Tail-Index |
| 24 | 8 | `Reserved` | MUST be `0x00` |

#### 4.2.2 Schema Header
Present when `Flags` Bit 1 is set. Immediately follows the Preamble.

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `KeyCount` | `u16` | Number of keys in the dictionary |
| `TypeManifest` | `u8[KeyCount]` | Sigil byte for each key, in dictionary order |
| `StringPool` | UTF-8 bytes | Null-terminated key name strings, concatenated |

The `StringPool` **MUST** be padded to an 8-byte boundary after the last null terminator.

---

## 5. Object Anatomy
Objects are the primary data container. To support sparse data (missing fields) without wasting space, objects use a **Bitmask + Offset Table** approach.

### 5.1 Object Header

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Magic` | 4 bytes | `0x4E58534F` (NXSO) |
| `Length` | 4 bytes | Total byte length of this object including header |
| `Bitmask` | Variable | LEB128-encoded presence mask (see 5.2) |
| `OffsetTable` | Variable | Per-present-field offsets (see 5.3) |

### 5.2 Variable-Width Bitmask
To support more than 64 keys, the bitmask uses a continuation-bit encoding (LEB128):
* The 7 least significant bits of each byte are data bits.
* The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is the **Continuation Bit**.
* If MSB = 1, the next byte is part of the mask.
* The bitmask encodes one bit per dictionary key, in dictionary order (key 0 = LSB of first byte).

### 5.3 The Offset Table
Immediately following the bitmask is the Offset Table.
* Each bit set to `1` in the mask corresponds to one entry in the Offset Table, in dictionary key order.
* **Normal Mode** (Flags Bit 0 = 0): `uint16_t` offsets (max object size 64KB).
* **Jumbo Mode** (Flags Bit 0 = 1): `uint32_t` offsets (max object size 4GB).
* Offsets are **relative to the first byte of the object header** (i.e., the `Magic` field).

### 5.4 Null Fields
A `^` (Null) field has its bitmask bit set to `1` and an entry in the Offset Table. The offset points to a single `0x00` byte. Parsers **MUST** distinguish a missing bit (field absent/unknown) from a Null entry (field explicitly set to null).

---

## 6. List Encoding
Lists are encoded as a typed array immediately within the Data Sector or an enclosing Object's data region.

### 6.1 List Header

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Magic` | 4 bytes | `0x4E58534C` (NXSL) |
| `Length` | 4 bytes | Total byte length of this list including header |
| `ElemSigil` | 1 byte | Sigil byte of all elements (uniform type enforced) |
| `ElemCount` | 4 bytes | Number of elements (`uint32_t`) |
| `Padding` | 3 bytes | `0x00` (aligns data to 8-byte boundary from Magic) |

### 6.2 List Data
Immediately follows the header. Elements are laid out contiguously, each obeying the Rule of 8 (Section 4.1). For variable-length types (String, Binary), elements are length-prefixed and tail-padded individually.

---

## 7. The Tail-Index (O(1) Access)
The Tail-Index is located at the end of the file at the offset given by `TailPtr` in the Preamble. It allows a reader to locate top-level records without a linear scan.

| Field | Size | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EntryCount` | 4 bytes | `uint32_t` total number of indexed records |
| `RecordArray` | Variable | Pairs of `KeyID (u16)` and `AbsoluteOffset (u64)`, Little-Endian |
| `FooterPtr` | 4 bytes | `uint32_t` offset back to the start of the Tail-Index |
| `MagicFooter` | 4 bytes | `0x2153584E` (`NXS!`) |

The final 8 bytes of the file are always `FooterPtr` + `MagicFooter`, allowing a reader to locate the Tail-Index by seeking to `EOF - 8`.

---

## 8. Advanced Operations

### 8.1 Delta Patching
Because NXS uses fixed-width cells for atomic types and length-prefixes for blobs, clients **MAY** perform in-place updates. To update a value:
1. Locate the object via the Tail-Index.
2. Identify the value offset via the Object's Offset Table.
3. Overwrite the specific bytes.
4. **Note:** If a String/Binary update exceeds the original length, the entire object **MUST** be relocated to the end of the file and the Tail-Index updated.

### 8.2 Linking (`&`)
The Link sigil `&` stores a signed 32-bit Little-Endian integer. This value is a **relative byte offset from the first byte of the `&` field's own encoded value** to the first byte of the target object's Magic header. A positive value points forward in the file; a negative value points backward.

Circular links (a chain of `&` references that resolves back to its origin) **MUST** be detected and rejected by parsers. Parsers **SHOULD** limit link-chain depth to 16 hops.

---

## 9. Security and Constraints
1. **Recursion Limit:** Conformant parsers **MUST** support at least 64 levels of nesting but **SHOULD** reject files exceeding this limit to prevent stack exhaustion.
2. **Bounds Checking:** All offsets **MUST** be validated against the total buffer size before memory access. An out-of-bounds offset is a parse error; the parser **MUST NOT** attempt recovery.
3. **Dictionary Drift:** If the `DictHash` in the Preamble does not match the expected local schema, the parser **MUST** prioritize the **Embedded Schema Header** or fail with error `ERR_DICT_MISMATCH` if none is present.
4. **Integer Overflow:** Arithmetic in Macro expressions **MUST** be performed in 64-bit signed arithmetic. Overflow is a compile error.
5. **Circular Links:** See Section 8.2.
