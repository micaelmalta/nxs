## The Problem

JSON was designed to be read by humans and transmitted over HTTP — not to serve as an in-memory query layer for millions of records. At scale, the parsing overhead becomes the bottleneck: every field is a heap allocation, every number is a string that must be converted, and the entire payload must be decoded before the first record can be accessed. CSV has the same decode cost with no type information at all. Protobuf solves the type problem but sacrifices human readability and requires schema compilation tooling that couples producers and consumers. None of them can be memory-mapped and queried without a full parse pass, and none are safe to share across threads or web workers without copying.

## What is NXS

NXS (Nexus Standard) is a bi-modal data format with two representations. The text format (`.nxs`) is a sigil-typed, human-readable source language compiled by a Rust tool. The binary format (`.nxb`) is a zero-copy wire format designed around CPU-native memory alignment. Because the binary layout encodes type and offset information at write time, a reader can locate any record by index, decode any single field by key, and run columnar reducers over millions of records — all without parsing the file.

## The Four Pillars

| Pillar | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fast** | 8-byte aligned atomic cells enable zero-copy reads. No deserialization pass required to access a field. |
| **Flexible** | LEB128 bitmask tracks field presence per record. Sparse objects carry no overhead for absent fields. |
| **Compressible** | All field names are interned into a dictionary. Records store 2-byte indices, not repeated strings. |
| **Human Readable** | The `.nxs` source format is self-describing plain text. Each value carries its type via a leading sigil character. |

## Benchmark Numbers

All benchmarks use an 8-field record schema on an Apple M-series (arm64), macOS. See [`BENCHMARK.md`](./BENCHMARK.md) for the full cross-language results.

## Browser Demos

Live at **[nxs.covibe.us](https://nxs.covibe.us/index.html)**

| Demo | What it shows |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`bench.html`](js/bench.html) | NXS vs JSON vs CSV — open, random access, reducer, cold pipeline — up to 14M records |
| [`ticker.html`](js/ticker.html) | 60 FPS in-place byte patch vs full JSON re-parse — jank visible in sparkline |
| [`workers.html`](js/workers.html) | 4 Web Workers, 1 `SharedArrayBuffer`, 0 bytes copied — vs 57 MB × 4 for JSON |
| [`explorer.html`](js/explorer.html) | 10M-line log explorer — virtual scroll, live search, zero-copy |

```bash
cd js && python3 server.py   # required for SharedArrayBuffer (sets COOP/COEP headers)
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Example

Every value in a `.nxs` file carries a sigil that declares its machine type — no schema file, no generated code:

```text
user {
    id:         =42
    username:   "alice_wonder"
    email:      "alice@example.com"
    age:        =31
    balance:    ~2874.99
    active:     ?true
    role:       $admin
    created_at: @2022-03-15
    tags:       [$admin, $beta, $verified]
    address {
        city:    "Springfield"
        country: "US"
    }
}
```

| Sigil | Type | Binary encoding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `=` | Int64 | 8 bytes LE |
| `~` | Float64 | 8 bytes IEEE 754 LE |
| `?` | Bool | 1 byte + 7 bytes padding |
| `$` | Keyword (interned) | 2-byte dict index |
| `"` | String | u32 length + UTF-8 bytes |
| `@` | Timestamp (Unix ns) | 8 bytes LE |
| `<>` | Binary blob | u32 length + raw bytes |
| `&` | Link | 4-byte relative offset |
| `!` | Macro | Resolved at compile time |
| `^` | Null | Zero-width (bitmask bit set) |

## Format Overview

A `.nxb` file is four segments: a 32-byte preamble, an embedded schema header, a data sector, and a tail-index. The tail-index holds one `(KeyID, AbsoluteOffset)` pair per top-level record and is located by reading the last 8 bytes — enabling O(1) random access with a single seek. All atomic values are 8-byte aligned, allowing zero-copy reads on any little-endian platform.

```

## CI

Every language has its own GitHub Actions workflow triggered on changes to its directory. Fixtures are generated once by the Rust workflow and shared as artifacts. See [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/).

---

## Status

**Proof of concept.** The spec is complete and all ten language implementations pass their test suites. Not production-ready — no versioned release, no stability guarantee on the binary layout, no formal conformance test suite. Benchmarks are real but run on a single machine against synthetic data.
