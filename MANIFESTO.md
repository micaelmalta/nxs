# The NXS Manifesto

## The parsing tax is a choice we keep making

Every time a service reads a million-row dataset, it pays the same toll: allocate memory for every string, convert every number from text, decode the whole file before touching a single field. We have accepted this as the cost of interoperability. It is not. It is the cost of formats designed before memory mapping existed as a practical tool.

JSON was designed to flow over HTTP between browsers and servers. It does that beautifully. It was not designed to be an in-memory query layer for 1.5 GB of records in a tab that needs to stay responsive at 60 frames per second. We are using a transit format as a storage format, and we are paying for it at runtime, constantly, in milliseconds that add up to seconds.

CSV strips the types out entirely and calls it simplicity. Protocol Buffers puts the schema in a separate file, generates code you have to check in, and still doesn't give you random record access. FlatBuffers gets close — zero-copy within a single object — but a multi-record file has no cross-record index. You cannot jump to record 800,000 without reading the 799,999 before it.

None of them were wrong. They solved the problem they were aimed at. NXS is aimed at a different problem.

---

## What we actually want

A format that a human can write, read in a diff, and commit to version control — without ceremony, without schema registries, without generated code.

A format that a machine can open in microseconds, regardless of how many records it contains.

A format where reading one field from record 800,000 does not require loading records 1 through 799,999.

A format that is safe to hand to multiple threads and web workers simultaneously, without copying.

A format where absent is not the same as null, because they are not the same thing.

These are not contradictions. They are the design brief.

---

## The two representations

NXS is bi-modal. The text format (`.nxs`) is a sigil-typed source language. The binary format (`.nxb`) is what the machine reads.

In `.nxs`, every value declares its type with a single leading character — its sigil. `=` for Int64, `~` for Float64, `?` for Bool, `"` for String, `@` for Time. No quotes around keys unless you want them. No trailing commas. No schema file to maintain separately. The source is the schema.

```
user {
    id:     =1024
    name:   "Alex"
    active: ?true
    score:  ~98.6
    joined: @1735689600000000000
}
```

The Rust compiler reads this text and writes a `.nxb` file. That file is what all six language implementations consume. It is not compiled once and read once. It is compiled once and read arbitrarily, in O(1) per record, across whatever languages your stack happens to use.

---

## Why the binary works

Three decisions make the binary format fast enough to matter.

**8-byte alignment.** Every atomic value — integer, float, timestamp — sits at a file offset divisible by 8. A memory-mapped `.nxb` file can be cast directly to typed pointers without a copy-to-aligned-buffer step. The processor loads it natively. SIMD loops over lists need no realignment pass. Bool fields waste 7 bytes of padding. That is the honest cost of the guarantee, and it is worth it.

**The Tail-Index.** The last 8 bytes of every `.nxb` file point to an index that holds one `(KeyID, AbsoluteOffset)` pair per top-level record. To open a file with 14 million records: seek to EOF minus 8, read the pointer, jump to the index, binary-search for your record, follow its absolute offset to the data. The rest of the file has not been touched. Open time is measured in nanoseconds, not milliseconds.

**The LEB128 bitmask.** Each object header carries a variable-width presence mask. A set bit means the field is there; a clear bit means it was never written. Sparse objects carry no overhead for absent fields. When every record in a file shares the same schema — the common case — the bitmask and offset table are identical for every record after the first, and implementations can skip parsing them entirely.

## What the numbers say

On 1M records, across six implementations, on the same machine:

Opening and reading one field from a 1.5 GB file: under 2 microseconds for NXS. JSON throws `Invalid string length`. CSV runs out of memory.

A Go cold pipeline — open the file, sum a float column over 1M records — takes 10.9 ms in NXS versus 1.05 seconds parsing JSON. 105× faster, not because of tricks, because the format was designed for the task.

In the browser, at 60 FPS, NXS patches a value in place as a direct byte write. JSON re-parses the full payload on every frame.

These are not cherrypicked microbenchmarks. They reflect what happens when a format's access model matches the workload.

---

## What this is not

NXS is not a replacement for JSON over HTTP. JSON is excellent there.

NXS is not a database. It has no query planner, no indexing beyond the tail-index, no transaction model.

NXS is not finished. The spec is complete. The six language implementations pass their test suites. The binary layout is not yet frozen. There are no versioned releases, no stability guarantees, no conformance test suite. This is a proof of concept, written to test whether the design holds together under real implementation pressure.

It does.

---

## The design rules

**The source format is authoritative.** `.nxs` files live in version control. The binary is a build artifact.

**The binary format is the contract.** Any conformant reader in any language reads the same bytes the same way. The spec is the contract, not any specific implementation.

**Absent and null are different.** A field with no bitmask bit is absent — it was never written. A field with a bitmask bit pointing to `0x00` is null — it was explicitly set to nothing. These have different semantics. Implementations that conflate them are wrong.

**Alignment is not optional.** The Rule of 8 applies to every atomic value, in every file, with no exceptions. This is what makes zero-copy reads safe.

**Bounds checking is not optional.** Every offset from an offset table, the tail-index, or any in-file pointer must be validated before the memory access. An out-of-bounds offset is an error; a conformant parser does not attempt recovery.

---

## Six languages, one format

The reference implementations cover Rust, JavaScript, Python, Go, Ruby, and PHP. Each reads the same `.nxb` file. Each exposes the same lookup model: resolve a key to a slot index once, reuse it across all records. Each provides columnar reducers for aggregate queries. Some provide C extensions. The JavaScript implementation works in Node, in the browser, and in Web Workers sharing a `SharedArrayBuffer` with zero bytes copied between threads.

The point is not comprehensiveness for its own sake. The point is that a `.nxb` file is not owned by one ecosystem. It is a shared artifact. The writer can be Rust; the readers can be anything.

---

## An invitation

The spec is in `SPEC.md`. The RFC with security guidance and implementation notes is in `RFC.md`. Working code for all six languages is in this repository. The browser demos show the format under conditions — 14 million records, 60 FPS frame updates, virtual scroll over 10 million log lines — that motivated the design.

Implement it, break it, tell us where the spec is ambiguous. That is how a proof of concept becomes a standard.
